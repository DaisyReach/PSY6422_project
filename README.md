# PSY6422_project

This project visualises electricity production from different energy sources in the United Kingdom between the years 1985 and 2021. The aim of this project was to see the trends of electricity production by source over the years, to see if there has been a big change in the main means of electricity production over time and if renewable sources are starting to produce more electricty in recent years.

This project includes contents on Data Origins, Research Question, Data Preperation, Visualisations and a Summary. You can navigate through these by the table of contents.

Under visualisations you can see an animated time series graph of Electricty Production by the differnt sources over time and an interactive bar graph showing amount of electricity produced by source depending on the year you wish to look at.
